With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index. Therefore, there can be only one clustered index.

With a non clustered index there is a second list that has pointers to the physical rows. You can have many non clustered indices,
although each new index will increase the time it takes to write new records.

• Clustered/unclustered
– Clustered = records close in index are close in data
– Unclustered = records close in index may be far in data


Primary/secondary
– Meaning 1:
• Primary = is over attributes that include the primary key
• Secondary = otherwise
– Meaning 2: means the same as clustered/unclustered

Clustered
– Index determines the location of indexed records
– Typically, clustered index is one where values are
data records (but not necessary)
• Unclustered
– Index cannot reorder data, does not determine
data location
– In these indexes: value = pointer to data record


order of columns in index matters ??


multi column index
if you are using index with ( state , city , zip )
& ur querire is on state city or on city zip

but if you queries are just on zip so this index wont be used

Key	Triggers	Stored procedures
1

Basic

trigger is a stored procedure that runs automatically when various events happen (eg update, insert, delete)

Stored procedures are a pieces of the code in written in PL/SQL to do some specific task

2

        Running Methodology

It can execute automatically based on the events

It can be invoked explicitly by the user

3

Parameter

It can not take input as parameter

It can take input as a parameter

4

Transaction statements

we can't use transaction statements inside a trigger

We can use transaction statements like begin transaction, commit transaction, and rollback inside a stored procedure

5

Return

Triggers can not return values

Stored procedures can return values



Sr. No.	Key	Function	Procedure
1	Definition	A function is used to calculate result using given inputs.	A procedure is used to perform certain task in order.
2	Call	A function can be called by a procedure.	A procedure cannot be called by a function.
3	DML	DML statments cannot be executed within a function.	DML statements can be executed within a procedure.
4	SQL, Query	A function can be called within a query.	A procedure cannot be called within a query.
5	SQL, Call	Whenever a function is called, it is first compiled before being called.	A procedure is compiled once and can be called multiple times without being compiled.
6	SQL, Return	A function returns a value and control to calling function or code.	A procedure returns the control but not any value to calling function or code.
7	try-catch	A function has no support for try-catch	A procedure has support for try-catch blocks.
8	SELECT	A select statement can have a function call.	A select statemnt can't have a procedure call.
9	Explicit Transaction Handling	A function can not have explicit transaction handling.	A procedure can use explicit transaction handling.





Sr. No.	Key	SQL	PL/SQL
1	Definition	SQL, is Structural Query Language for database.	PL/SQL is a programming language using SQL for a database.
2	Variables	SQL has no variables.	PL/SQL has variables, data types etc.
3	Control Structures	SQL has no FOR loop, if control and similar structures.	PL/SQL has FOR loop, while loop, if controls and other similar structures.
4	Operations	SQL can execute a single operation at a time.	PL/SQL can perform multiple operation at a time.
5	Language Type	SQL is a declarative language.	PL/SQL is a procedural language.
6	Embedded	SQL can be embedded in a PL/SQL block.	PL/SQL can also be embedded in SQL code.
6	Interaction	SQL directly interacts with database server.	PL/SQL does not directly interacts with database server.
7	Orientation	SQL is data oriented language.	PL/SQL is application oriented language.
8	Objective	SQL is used to write queries, create and execute DDL and DML statments.	PL/SQL is used to write program blocks, functions, procedures, triggers and packages.
